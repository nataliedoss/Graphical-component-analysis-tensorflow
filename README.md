# Graphical Component Analysis via Deep Energy Estimator Networks
This is a TensorFlow implementation of the algorithm described in Section 4.5 of <a href="https://github.com/nataliedoss/Thesis/blob/master/main.pdf" download>Chapter 4: Graphical component analysis for latent signal detection</a>. As in the original variant of graphical component analysis (GCA) <a href=<https://github.com/nataliedoss/Graphical-component-analysis-R">Graphical component analysis (GCA)</a>, we allow for latent signal detection when the hidden source components have dependence modeled by a pairwise graphical model structure. But in this version, the node and pairwise density components are represented using neural networks (multilayer perceptrons).
