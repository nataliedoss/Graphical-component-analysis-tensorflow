# Graphical Component Analysis via Deep Energy Estimator Networks
This is a TensorFlow implementation of the algorithm described in Section 4.5 of <a href="https://github.com/nataliedoss/Thesis/blob/master/main.pdf" download>Chapter 4: Graphical component analysis for latent signal detection</a>. As in the original variant, <a href="https://github.com/nataliedoss/Graphical-component-analysis-R" download>Graphical component analysis (GCA)</a>, we allow for latent signal detection when the hidden source components have dependence modeled by a pairwise graphical model structure. But in this version, the node and pairwise density components are represented using neural networks (multilayer perceptrons). The neural network parameters are estimated using stochastic gradient descent; the implementation is in TensorFlow.
